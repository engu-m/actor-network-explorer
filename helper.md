# Co-stardom network

Works best on Desktop.

Get started by searching for your favorite actor and clicking on the "Add" button, or by hitting the ðŸŽ² button.
Two actors are connected in the graph if they both played in at least onemovie.
The graph is interactive! You can select and move nodes and edges anywhere.
Selecting a node reveals the number of connections the actor currently has in the graph, as well as basic personal information.
Selecting an edge reveals the common movies these two actors have.
You can select simultaneously multiple nodes and edges with Ctrl+click or with a rectangle box selection Ctrl+move.
Remove actors with one of the three right-most buttons in the top right-corner, or by specifying his/her name in the right panel then clicking "Remove".
When you add an actor, only his/her relationships are shown, but not the ones of those who played with him/her. Hence, two people may have played together but share no connectionon the graph if they were not individually added.
Finally, filter the view more easily with the automatic filter text input.


Disclaimer: the dataset is not exhaustive, some movies/actors may be missing.
